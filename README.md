# Biography
I am ==Justinas==. I come from a Europe country Lithuania, I love the look of post Soviet country, something about the depressive look of the *chruščiovkes* ant the mood that it gives to me. Motivation to improve the country.

I like to study new skills like photography, software development, 3d modeling, game development, movie making, digital art, server maintenance and Linux. Specifically **arch** Linux. 

I suck at the usual school system, almost past it, but I like to stay home and learn skills on my one. I can call my self a *Jack of all trades, master of none*. And that's me programmer wanna be.
